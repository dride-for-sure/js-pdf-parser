# JavaScript PDF Parser

This tool parses pdfs with hugh file sizes in chunks and analyze pfds on the cliend-side to keep server load low.

### Features
- Load hugh files in small chunks
- Discard data streams like images, just keep the gathered metadata about it
- Build the pagetree with all available metadata

This is alpha and and still for a while not meant for production. 

**Of course i am always glad to receive feature requests and ideas.**

Happy coding! :metal:
